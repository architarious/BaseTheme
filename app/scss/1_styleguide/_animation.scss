/*USAGE

  Once your files have been added to your project and you've customized your @imports, you can start including the animations directly to your classes.

  .your-class-name {
    @include bounceIn();
  }
  The mixin includes configurable options to customize the delay, count duration, function and fill-mode of your animations.
  
  .your-class-name {
    @include bounceIn(
      $duration: 1s,
      $count: 2,
      $delay: .2s,
      $function: ease, 
      $fill: both
    );
  }
